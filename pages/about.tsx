                Product Development Club before rebranding to VikeLabs.

                VikeLabs is a collective of students who learn to build, deploy,
                and test software by developing solutions to problems that exist
                within the UVic community and beyond. In the process members are
                able to learn about software development, product management,
                and design.

                faculty and are always looking for outside ideas and
                perspectives.

                At the beginning of the school year we do a large brainstorm,
                where we invite all club members to come together and think up
                new project ideas. We take the ideas that we think will have the
                best impact in helping others around UVic and are feasible to
                implement. Then solidify those ideas, recruit team leads, and
                build out the project from there.
