## What is VikeLabs?
We're a group of students from the University of Victoria who build software applications that solve real world problems. VikeLabs is composed on autonomous product teams who work to build, deploy, and test software applications. We have roles for students interested in development, design, and product management. We invite everyone who participates in this hackathon to come and join us! But you don't have to.

- Access to a network of students who are passionate about learning by doing.
