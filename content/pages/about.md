description: VikeLabs is a collective of students who learn to build, deploy, and test software quickly. We view UVic as a kind of laboratory for testing solutions to problems that exist within the UVic community. We limit ourselves to the UVic community because it's much easier to deploy and test solutions to users where we are in close proximity to them and their problems. Feel free to reach out.
