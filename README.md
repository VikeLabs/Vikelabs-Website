# VikeLabs.ca
**TODO:** Write a more thorough `README`.

## Basics
- This website is built using the Gatsby framework, which is a static site generator based on React.
    - If you know React, you're in luck!
    - If you don't know React, you can learnt it and use it for dynamic applications too!
- The original template website is from [gatsby-starter-netlify-cms](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms).
- **DO CONTRIBUTE!** Feel free to customize this website and make pull-requests as you see fit. We will peer review these changes and merge them into the repository once it is determined that:
    - This does not break any required existing features.
    - It does not take away from the goal of being an information portal about all things VikeLabs.
    - The changes are documented so others can easily understand the changes that were made..

**REMEMBER**, VikeLabs is a learning experience so mistakes are totally fine! We encourage you to contribute any code you think would make this website better!

## Develop
Please refer to the original [README](https://github.com/vikelabs/Vikelabs-Website/blob/master/ORIGINAL.md) for detailed instructions on how to setup the development environment and other useful information.

If you're already familiar with JavaScript development then:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Will get you up and running with Gatsby and this repository immediately!
