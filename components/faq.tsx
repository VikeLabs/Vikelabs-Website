    title: "What is the groupâ€™s purpose?",

    title: "What are the criteria for taking on a project?",
    body: "At the beginning of the school year we do a large brainstorm, where we invite all club members to come together and think up new project ideas.

Then solidify those ideas, recruit team leads, and build out the project from there.",

    title: "Where do project ideas usually come from?",
    body: "As above, the project ideas are a product of many innovative minds coming together to solve problems and think of solutions, mainly surrounding UVic.",
